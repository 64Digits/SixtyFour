## Dependencies
Python dependencies are defined in requirements.txt and can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## SCSS Dependencies
SCSS compilation requires Autoprefixer to be available on the CLI.
The easiest way to do this is to install `npx` globally via `npm`,
then run `npm install` in the root of the repo to install the
dependencies (`postcss-cli` and `autoprefixer`)
